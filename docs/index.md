# Welcome to Healthcare.ai!

The aim of **healthcareai** is to streamline machine learning in healthcare with two main goals:

- Allow one to easily create models based on tabular data, and deploy a good model that pushes predictions to a database (MSSQL, MySQL, SQLite, CSV).
- Provide tools related to data cleaning, manipulation, and imputation.

## Where's the Source Code?

## Do I Want This Package or the [R package](http://healthcare.ai/r)?

Choose this Python package if one of the following apply:

- You're familiar with python
- You're familiar with machine learning
- You're working with 5M+ rows

Otherwise, the [R package](http://healthcare.ai/r) is recommended, as it
currently has more features and R is tends to be more newbie-friendly.
